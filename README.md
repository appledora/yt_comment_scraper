# Query-based youtube comment scraper

This is a simple script that scrapes youtube comments based on a query. It uses [Selenium]() CHROME driver to automate the process of scrolling through the comments and extracting them.


### Link Generation 
You need a list of queries to creat a list of links to scrape. The script `compile_links.py` does this. It takes a text file with a list of queries. For each query a json file is created with a list of links to scrape and associated metadata. The json file is named after the query.

The script takes the following arguments:
```bash
python compile_links.py --query_file query.txt --output_dir links --max_scroll 3 --number_of_videos 10
```

### Scraping Comments
The script `scrape_comments.py` scrapes the comments from the links generated by `compile_links.py`. It takes the following arguments:
```bash

python scrape_comments.py --json_directory links --output_dir comments --max_comments 1000 --max_scroll 3
```
