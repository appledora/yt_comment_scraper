My dad was the biggest Dune fan ever (books and old film). He was so excited when this trailer came out. Sadly due to the Covid delays he passed away before it was released. When it comes out I'll be watching it day one and he'll be there with me in spirit. Hope you enjoy it Dad x,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Even Herbert himself wouldn't have found the words to describe how good this film is. A life-long Dune fan to other Dune fans, they didn't ruin it. They might have somehow elevated Dune to another level and I didn't think that would ever be possible. See it as a soon as possible on the biggest screen you can find.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Watched this masterpiece a couple hours ago in the theater and one word “speechless” it was BEYOND incredible. It was phenomenal.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Man I am so glad Oscar Issac is getting so many roles these days, his screen presence was terrific in it.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"People need to understand that Dune isn't a flashy, fast-paced thrill ride like Star wars, it is focused more on philosophies, worldbuilding and conveying lore than instant giving audiences their dopamine fix, its much more artistic than gimmicky. It is an adaption of a book that prompts readers to think, so if you go into cinema expecting simple fun than you will be dissapointed, Dune is anything bot simple and is not for everyone.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
The sound design in this movie is off the charts. It had better get nominated for an Oscar.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I can’t describe in words how much I hope this movie doesn’t disappoint me.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Absolutely amazing choice to put Eclipse by Pink Floyd in this trailer. It gave me goosebumps, and it matched the vibe of the movie perfectly.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I Just watched dune yesterday and this is the adaptation that we were waiting for, the score, the scale, the story. All of it was amazing. Let's hope that hits the box office for Dune part two",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I think 2:02 may be the most stunning scene in the movie. The visual effects perfectly encapsulate the massiveness of the sandworm and the desert, and the music perfectly enhances that. Every scene was a piece of art, but if I had to choose one, I'd choose this.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Just saw it in the cinema. It could very well be the most epic film I've ever seen. I worked for 12 years as a projectionist so I've seen a LOT of films. Finally this fantastic story has gotten the screen adaptation it deserves. The gravity of the books has been captured perfectly in this film, it's absolutely unreal. Incomparable. I'm going to see it on the big screen again next week. The only other movies I did that for was the LOTR trilogy.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
It rarely happens: the film is so much better than this trailer.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"for those wondering why they are using swords thousands of years into the future:

0:49 most people carry these personal shields on them. they completely deflect any fast moving projectiles. guns are obsolete, but there are beam energy weapons called Lasguns, which are somewhat common. however, they arent widely used because a Lasgun beam hitting a personal shield triggers a massive explosion (pretty much nuclear). so both people would die. ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Never read the books or watched the original movie. This was mind blowingly amazing. It's rare that a movie draws me in and captivates me to the degree this movie did. The acting, music, pace, special FX and story were all 100% on point.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This trailer was well done, but the truth is, the movie is even better! Was NOT expecting that…",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This movies soundtrack was everything, Hans Zimmer never dissapoints",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I love how Herbert chose different cultures/civilizations for his ""House"" paradigm.  House Atreides = Greek, descendants of Alexander the Great.  House Corrino = Roman, descendants of Julius Caesar.  House Harkonnen = Swedish/Finnish descendants of German ""barbarian"" tribes.  The Fremen = Arabic nomadic tribesmen, hence their language is high influenced by Arabic.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I must admit, I have become obsessed. This has been the best introduction to a novel series for me since Harry Potter. And looking at how big that story became it was inevitable I'd be swept in by the beauty of another. Frank Herbert is a genius and in spite of this movie, even in the spectacular attempt it has made to echo the story, indeed it is the writing that is the bright moon that sparks the light in this gem. ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This trailer got me so intrigued with the world of Dune that I started reading the book. It does not dissapoint. Now my most anticipated film of 2021.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Every single person that worked on this film should be extremely proud. A true masterpiece,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I’ve seen the movie more than 10 times and this trailer still gives me chills,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Such a unique film! I absolutely loved it. Except it wasnt just a film, it was an experience. Watched it twice on the big screen and still adore it 4 months later! The way it was filmed, edited, the visual effects, the acting and music all culminated into an epic, must-see visual masterpiece. They are definitely deserving of the 6 oscars and 10 nominations. I can't wait for part 2!!! This is only the beginning ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Important fact, this film received 10 nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the most awards at the ceremony with six awards for Best Sound, Original Soundtrack, Film Editing, production design, visual effects and photography",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I first watched the movie twice in cinema and now Ive read book one and two and when seeing that trailer again, it just boggles my mind how well Denis has brought all the characters and worlds to life.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer” - Me hyping myself up to go into a theater to see this,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
To put simply: WOW! You can really feel that someone who LOVES Dune brought this together. My gosh this was even better than I expected it to be!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I had a passing interest in dune before. The new movie was fantastic, but I still find myself coming back to watch this trailer. It's absolutely masterful and got me so excited about a fantasy world I knew nearly nothing about.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This movie was the mature and gritty story I've always wanted from star wars. It was f*king awesome. 10/10 can't wait for more.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Just watched this movie yesterday and masterpiece indeed. So visually epic and deserves to have a sequel of it's other half immediately. As a bookreader, it delivers well onscreen.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"The first time i watched this movie was just an amazing experience! the music the vibes everything about it, it made me addicted with dune and now part 2 will probably be one of the best movies ever i’m not even kidding! thank you denis and thank you hans and everyone inthe dune team you truly deserve those 6 oscar’s!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Watched this movie around an hour ago. It is a masterpiece and everyone should go to the cinema to witness the full power of visuals and sound!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Just watched it and man it does not disappoint!
Loved it from start to finish one of the most faithful and honourable adaptations in a while. It’s a visual and auditory masterpiece that needs a sequel to finish this compelling piece of art.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"For anyone wondering, the movie was absolutely spectacular! Please go see it in the theatre if you can, it's a cinematic experience of a lifetime.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I love this film. It really transports me. Watched it yesterday for the second time. Never had a film that makes me want to dabble in hallicinagenics before. Extraordinary.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"OMG️️! I really loved every second of this film. I want more 

The World building was phenomenal and the film uses drag elements with care that it won't bore the audience. The visuals are stunning and the plot is solid. There's plenty of room for more development and I'm so excited to hopefully see part 2 ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"For anyone wondering.

The reason they’re using swords and knives in the future is because they all have personal energy shields which can stop lasers/ bullets but can’t stop slow moving objects like blades.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"After finishing this film all I can say is, you need to see it to experience it. This is one of the greatest films of all time",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Saw this absolute masterpiece on imax. Enjoyed every bit of it. Not one unnecessary scene or lame joke. This movie brought back hope on good movies,which we used to watch before the MCU came and destroyed this current generation's idea of a good movie",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This movie is mesmerizing. Audio visually, it's a masterpiece. Even the story is a mystery and I really hope it pays off in the sequel.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"The movie was insane. The camerwork and music and performances everything was awesome. I especially liked how the showed how huge, powerful and ominous some of the houses and Imperium are",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
The visuals and sound design is damn good. Every shot is atmospheric and beautiful and believable as well. If part 2 keeps up the quality and artistry this will be the sort of thing they show in film schools to show what’s done right,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I just want to say that nearly all if not every single line in this trailer was pulled directly from the book. Coupled with the fact that this is a long time dream of Denis Villeneuve’s, I would say that this movie is going to be incredible.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I’ve seen it a couple hours ago and I’m still in awe 
What a masterpiece it is",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
One of the greatest cinematic experiences you'll ever have,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I dont understand why this has so little attention, its incredible! The music choice, the pacing, the rising tension, the dramaaaaaaaaaa!!! Then once the momentum builds and we get the fast cuts and crazy shots one after the other, I just love it. This is great work thank you for sharing it with us.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I just came back from the cinema, it's amazing, honestly the movie has so much potential. The universe needs to be expanded on a lot more, can't wait for part 2.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"It was thanks to this official trailer that I became a fan of the Dune novels and this movie, thanks to Warner Bros. Pictures and Dennis Villeneuve for adapting it perfectly, even though they divided it into 2 parts.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I have never read the books,  never seen the old film. 
I saw this film and was blown away,  it's nothing like any other film I've seen,  a real experience.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I've seen the movie 4 times and watching this trailer still makes me want to go watch it again.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This movie far exceeded my expectations. It was a dream come true. “Dreams are messages from the deep,”",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I can’t describe in word how much I love this movie ️,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
The ONLY movie I've ever been in favor of remaking and they absolutely nailed it!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I went to this movie not knowing anything about it and it was amazing! I hope there is a part 2 because I need more. Seeing the movie has also made me want to read the books.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Looks stunning and the cast is insane. Plus it's directed by Denis Villeneuve who made two of the best sci-fi films of the decade, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. One of the best contemporary film directors in the world.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I remember when this trailer came out and it mesmerized me. I became obsessed with the story, read the first 3 books so far and I love everyone in this cast, Villeneuve is my favorite director working today, Hans Zimmer always delivers, cannot wait for part 2 when the story becomes non stop climaxes. This film was a masterpiece and part 2 will top it.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
For the duration of the movie I was on planet Arrakis. Truly a masterpiece. Reading the books right now,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This movie... I can't believe how freaking good it was... and the music... it was like a separate movie in itself,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This is the movie I saw in years that took me to that world. It is a rare feat only some can achieve. Now, I am excited to read the book, too.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Frank Herbert’s Dune series is my all time favorite book series.  This movie was the epitome of film doing literary justice.  I LOVED the movie!!  Soooo hoping Hollywood will transform the 2nd book into another film achievement.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Mr. Denis Villeneuve is out here saving 2020, this trailer is just FANTASTIC!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Shoutout to everyone that came back to this trailer after seeing the film.  This is the Dune we deserved. ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Just finally saw this. I saw the original in the theater when I was a teenager. This was so freaking amazing! So happy he's doing a sequel and a series!!!! ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
The music in this trailer is incredible. Especially for a Pink Floyd and Hans Zimmer music fan. Would love to hear it live!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Acabo de verla hace unas horas, realmente me quede sin palabras tremenda joya, el hype valio la pena.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I’ve never been so conflicted about a movie in my life. I just left the theatre and I can’t decide if I liked it or not, it’s definitely an experience and a masterpiece in cinematography, OST and worldbuilding, that’s what kept me in my seat without wanting to leave altogether. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love heavy literature, I love lore, worldbuilding and in general everything that has layers and layers of symbolism and meanings so I was surprised by how I ended up deciding to just stick to read the novels (have planning on reading them anyway, in fact have been trying to get them for months but are sold out near me). But I won’t watch any further adaptation unless it’s a series or something similar. ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
It's hard to imagine this movie will capture the sort of scale the book has to it but if it does this could potentially be one of the greatest sci fi movies ever made (given that it's based off of one of the best sci fi books ever written),ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This was the absolute most incredible movie I have seen in ages.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I’ve just seen it. Enjoyed every second of it. How can a movie be so perfect?! So good,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This is not only one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen but one of the best movies I have ever seen, an absolute masterpiece.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Just saw this in the theaters…hands down the greatest sci-fi movie I’ve ever seen. It is literally perfect!!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"They did justice to the book. Amazing film. I felt I had to watch it on the theater and that was the right call. Casting, effects, script, soundtrack: everything wokrs on Dune!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I believe that this won't disappoint us. This director never created any bad films.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Was the wait for this movie's release almost unbearable? Yes it was. 
Was it worth it all to see a masterpiece adaptation of one of the best sci-fi stories of the 20th century on the big screen? WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. 
Denis Villeneuve, the cast and the crew didn't just knock the ball out of the proverbial park - they sent it flying straight through the atmosphere and into space.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"EPIC! Really impressed with DUNE. I haven't had such a euphoric cinema experience since Interstellar. In fact, I STRONGLY discourage anyone seeing it on any streaming site. Go see it at the theater while there is still time! The visuals are breathtaking, the actors on the whole are all good, the cinematography, the sound design, the visual effects, THE COSTUMES, all this while respecting the plot of the book (if you've never read it , the film should convince you)… and no, I did not forget the fantastic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer which is dazzling once again.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Everyone who loved this movie, was blown away by it and thinks it's a masterpiece, is my soulmate. I love you all",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I've just watched it and it really really does have a astounding visual ngl
The soundtrack, the visual, its just perfect!! I love the concept as well (I haven't read the book & seen the prev movie so...)
I HIGHLY recommended to see it in the cinema (if it is possible) its such a beautiful experience",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Fantastic! Utterly fantastic! I only regret not being able to experience this wonder in theaters. Villeneuve did it again!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This is meant to be seen in a cinema. There's no denying this fact.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I'm halfway through the book now, I have to say, I had not heard of Dune until the movie came out, so once I'm done with it, I'll watch the movie and see how well they adapted it",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"the actors the scenes, the dialogues woww really a good production ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"These scenes have blown my mind, i loved every single one of em, absolute art.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Almost a year and a half later. Saw the movie 7 times by now. It didn't disappointed. This trailer feels almost nostalgic now,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I first saw a shortened version of a Dune trailer in 2020 on Instagram, and I originally thought it was gonna be a bad adaptation because I was already beaten down by so many bad adaptations of things I love. Hearing good things about it, I decided to read the books. Loved those, and I love this movie. I’m sad that Dune 2 might not be in theaters, but I’ll watch it.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
It appears technology has finally reached the point where it can accurately depict what Herbert envisioned. And it is glorious.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I watched this and I couldn't believe how epic it was. Visually stunning... And grabs your attention right from GO!!!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Just watched it and it’s already one of my favorite movies of all time,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I just came back from the cinema and I can confidently say this is my favourite movie of 2021 so far. I'm devastated that I cant experience this movie for the first time again. A visual and sound masterpiece.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Just to add to all the gushing sentiments, I have always been obsessed with sci fi since seeing Star Wars as a little kid and I was completely oblivious to Dune. I was aware of it as I got older but didn’t think much of the origins of Sci fi until now as an adult that I’ve acquired a taste for the dark and philosophical side of sci fi. When I saw Blade Runner for the first time I started to understand the true vehicle of sci fi as foresight to our repercussions of the present. When I saw Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 it was like a watershed moment where I witnessed the most compelling design of a future I had ever seen, so nuanced that it felt real. When I saw this trailer I was already a Villeneuve disciple and was aware of the reverence of Dune.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Saw it earlier today, my favorite film of the year so far! What a masterpiece.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I finally finished the book and now I can fully understand why so many people are excited about this movie. This story, told by this director, with this cast. My gosh...",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This is sci-fi Lord of the Rings and I really hope we get the full trilogy. Go and see this at the cinema it’s a fantastic cinematic experience.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Actually, this trailer is quite good with promising. I hesitated myself from watching it until I see the movie - and now I see, that it wouldn't spoil too much. Also, actual visuals in the movie are way more breathtaking than those used in trailer, what makes the experience even better!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"""When fear is gone, only I will remain"" mind-blowing",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This movie is just fantastic, no other words to describe it. Loved it ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This was legit good, never read the books and vaguely remember the original but this was really good and so gorgeous to look at it. Excited for part 2",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"“The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience”
-Frank Herbert, Dune",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Every scene was a piece of art, but if I had to choose one, I'd choose this.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"If you have a chance to see this in IMAX, do it. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely blown away from a movie like I was with this",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Rest in peace, Frank Herbert. Your magnum opus has found its cinematic abode under the guidance of Denis Villeneuve.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This was well worth the wait.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Damn Gary Oldman cast as the sand worm that guy is so versatile,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
6 Oscars today. What an achievement. Absolutely deserved.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This is the best movie I have seen in about 10 years. I was on the edge of my seat every second. The only word I can think to describe it is epic. Every single stone, light, landscape or set in Dune was meticulously placed & planned. Each scene was beautiful. It is a literal masterpiece. The actors were all good but I especially enjoyed Jason Momoa.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"It’s been month since I saw The Dune for the first time. I still can’t get over it. I’m listening to this everyday, I read everything about the dune, I went second time to see the movie yesterday and today I’m going to see it again. The music blows my mind, visual aspect of the movie blows my mind, the plot blows my mind… This movie is a masterpiece",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I went to the concert of Hans Zimmer as composer 2 days ago in Oberhausen, Germany and was mesmerized about how much energy and blood the entire orchestra put into this masterpiece. I now understand what it means to FEEL MUSIC along with the MOVIE! Congratulations Dune",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Just finished the movie. Absolutely stellar casting. Excellent performances from Brolin, Skarsgard, and Issacs.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Dune is one of the greatest sci fi books of all time. The fact that so many great actors/actresses wanted in is zero surprise to sci fi book enthusiasts,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I've read all 6 original DUNE books, and seen the 80s film and the sci-fi channel series. This new movie is superb! Amazing acting, costumes, sets & cinematography, and the soundscape is awe inspiring. Highly recommend for DUNE fans and for any new to the story. I'm so impressed with how this film version takes the original source material and follows it so well within a movie setting (of course minor changes, or omissions, are necessary in a film). I was really worried the film & director would have a hard time balancing the deeper tension of the sociopolitical drama, the mystical & foreboding powers, as well as the action. The books often have very long monologs, pages of internal dialogue, & contextual information, so I was glad to see this film tackle these themes while still maintaining a beautiful, and enthralling film. My husband us unfamiliar with DUNE and he was totally drawn in by the story/plot, acting, and music. You can take anyone to see this film with you",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I always had faith in this director and he delivers big time. It feels like it's been such a long time since we had a smart slow-burner like this that's confident enough take to take you through such an amazing and rich story like Dune at its own pace. The cast is fantastic (especially Brolin as Gurney), the action set pieces are massive, and overall the visuals are just straight gorgeous. Also, massive props to Hans Zimmer on this soundtrack because it's perfect, nothing else should be said on that front. My only complaint is that it seems to suffer from the same complex as Lord of the Rings did; where it sacrifices some of slower scenes from the book that were devoted to world building like developing the culture and political factions for the big action scenes. For example, Paul's introduction to Mother Gaius was one of my favorite scenes in the book cause of how it introduced and built up the motivations behind the Empire, house Atreides, and the Bene Gesserit, and by extension a lot of the main characters. But to see all but 2 minutes devoted to this was a bit of a disappointment. However, this only makes up nitpicks in what was otherwise the best theatre experience I've had in a long time. Beyond estatic to see such a legendary novel get the big screen treatment it deserves.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This was perhaps my most anticipated film of the year, and it did not let me down. Denis Villeneuve, as usual, delivers a strong performance in this film. My only criticism is that I wish it was longer because the lore around the Dune universe is a lot to take in, and it felt a little jumpy at the beginning, but that could be because I watch too many shows and expect everything to be as detailed as an 8-hour episode. The movie's soundtrack was fantastic.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Can't explain how beautiful this movie is.. I watched it 5 times. Still can't get enough.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Looks so good,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This movie was so atmospheric. It felt as if you were actually stuck in the desert yourself. At the points where you actually got to see green it was like a breath of fresh air. Such an experience.



918",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
The hand to hand combat in this movie is unlike anything I’ve seen. Remarkable. Everything in this movie is unlike anything I’ve seen. I wasn’t so sure at first but then 20 min in and i was captivated. It really takes a lot to move me the way this did.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This was perhaps my most anticipated film of this year and it did not dissapoint. Denis Villeneuve like always has delievered strongly with this movie. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer because the whole lore surrounding the Dune universe is a lot to absorb and it seemed a bit jumpy in the early segments of the movie but maybe that's because I watch too many shows and expect everything to be as in depth as an 8 hour long show. The soundtrack for the movie was amazing it's Hans Zimmer so what more can we expect from the maestro. The scene with the sand worm towering over Paul in the last segment of the movie had powerful music and made the scene even greater. I was completely blank about what the story is about I did a bit of research but after watching the movie I feel like reading the books too the whole lore is so intriguing, it has so many layers to it. Timothee Chalomet is one of the most talented young actors out there right now and imo the best at the moment he compeletely embodies all the characters he plays as and I loved him in this movie although we got to see only a few intense scenes which seperates the great from the good and he did not let us down. Overall Villeneuve has built a strong base for a trilogy.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I’ve rewatched this movie about 17 times already, and I still get goosebumps when I watch the trailer.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I can’t wait for the soundtrack of this movie. Hans Zimmer has never disappointed me, so I have very high expectations for the soundtrack. It’s going to be very epic.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"4 months ago I went to watch this film on the big screen on its opening day. I had no prior knowledge about the film but found the storyline intriguing through the trailer. After that I watched it 2 more times. I absolutely love this film! I love how it wasnt just a film, it was an experience. The way it was filmed, edited, the visual effects, the acting and music all culminated into an epic, must-see visual masterpiece. They are definitely deserving of the 6 oscars and 10 nominations. I can't wait for part 2!!! This is only the beginning ",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Sadly I missed this movie at the cinema.... but saw it last night... very rarely do you come across a pitch perfect  film.. and this is one... 100% perfect in every way.. pace, plot, dialogue ... can't wait for the next one",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
They should be very proud of this film.  I've been waiting for years for an epic film and I have to say that it was the best cinematic three hours of the last decade.  I hope that there is a Part II here as this could be an Epic story continued.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I wish this movie didn't end. It was a perfect film that was an embodiment of how sci-fi movies should be made. This visual and audio masterpiece pleases the senses and captivates the imagination, letting you experience a different world while watching in awe as the spectacle unfolds in front of your eyes.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This feels like a movie that has to be seen at cinemas,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"It is pure brilliance and perfection.The acting is excellent, the lines are deep and memorable. It is just incredible.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I'm glad to be living in an age where technology and artistry are at a point where they can really breath life to a story like Dune,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
i loved this movie so much!!! The visuals of the setting and wardrobe were mesmerizing to me  I seriously cannot wait for part two to come out ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Those who hated this film is definitely brainless ...The aura dune produce is rare to find ...how can someone did not like this masterpiece,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"This is a movie you should absolutely experience in the cinema. The music, the sound effects and that combined with the overwhelming visuals, it's amazing. I'm pretty certain this movie doesn't feel the same when watching it on a television",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I haven't seen a decent major studio film in 30 years or so. Dune was more than just eye candy, they paid attention to the source material changing little except in interpretation from the written medium to the screen. Probably the best film in decades. There were a lot of people who got done watching this film and wanted more. Thank the production staff of this film for doing things right for once instead of turning it into a Apple+ Foundation.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I cannot describe in words how much I love this masterpiece. ️,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
15 minutes until Dune Part Two trailer comes out!!  ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"One of the greatest epic movies of all time
Thank you Denis Villeneuve

Saw it today. No regrets. No disappointment. No bad feeling. Absolute Banger.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Denis Villeneuve and team has done for Dune what Peter Jackson and team did for The Lord of The Rings. Another Epic film. I actually comprehended more of the story from this production that all of the previous attempts. Thank you for your attention to detail and I anxiously await the next installment(s).,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
They should have done a tv series. Such an incredible book. Everything about this film so far is simply amazing.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
That Arnis/Kali fight scene in the sand is something! Congrats to the whole Dune team for this great adaptation!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
It's an awesome movie. The musical scoring is out of this world.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"It’s hilarious how many people think Dune is ripping off so many movies, when it was Dune that inspired them all. It came out in 1965, people! It inspired two, almost three generations of pop culture and it continues to be relevant even to this day!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"What a gem,,,,even the actors look how I imagined them in the book.  About time this story received a big screen adaptation that did it the justice it deserves.  Hopefully they go all the way to God Emperor of Dune with the same actors.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This is was honestly the most exhilarating and free movie I’ve ever watched. It felt like an experience that a movie should give,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I dont regret watching this movie at all, totally worth it. It was just amazing and unique.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
watched the movie and fell in love with hom much imagination is in this movie. i been reading the comments on this movie and to hear the author of this story is ahead of his time he really is without a doubt. i have bren gifted the book and going to start reading it. & just so you know i’ve watched this movie 20+ times ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I now read the book. Saw the movie 3 times before that. I think if the second movie stays on this level and finishes the story of dune 1 the same it started, this is the best book adaption since lord of the rings. Masterpiece.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Brolin's delivery of ""they're not human, they're brutal!"" is just phenomenal",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
When I first saw the trailer I knew this was a theater only movie. Had the option to watch this on HBO max but waited to see in theaters for a month. Man it exceeded my expectations. I had no idea this was a book series by the way. I’m obsessed with this movie. An absolute gem.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
This movie was just awesome. I saw the original one in the theater but this was just outstanding cannot wait for part 2.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"The visuals, the soundtracks, and the story is  just perfect",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Congratulations to the whole production team, the whole movie was really great!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
it's so nice when something actually lives up to expectations ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
My sister died at the beginning of the pandemic. She and I loved the books so much and felt they were instrumental in our development as we grew up together. Watching this was bittersweet knowing she won't be here to see it. But I think she'd have been overwhelmed with how incredible this production looks - exactly how I feel now. I'm so excited for October 22nd.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Watched this movie yesterday and i can't stop thinking about it. The visuals, the soundtracks, the story.. it was just perfect..",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"The original trilogy blew my mind when I was just a kid.  It is in so many ways the best trilogy I've ever read and I've read Herbert's Dosadi series, Asimov's Foundation, Clarke's Oddysey, Clarke's Rama, Bored of the Rings and Stephen Kings The Gunslinger,  Mervin Peake's Ghormenghast  and a few other contenders but Herbert's Original Six is still the best.  Asimov and Clarke are a bit better in the ""hard"" science realm and that's it, but in the social dynamics realm and the inclusion of the psychodynamic ""spice"" - I'm just speechless, I can't believe they captured the zeitgeist.  I remember being nearly heartbroken at the other attempts, gallant though they were.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Everything about this film so far is simply amazing.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I've never seen a movie trailer that actually made me want to read the book,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Wtf. No best director nomination for Denis? This is a masterpiece.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Gosto muito do Timothée Chalamet, ele é incrível,  a forma como ele atua nos filmes, é de uma leveza e um profissionalismo maravilhoso, até fiz um desenho dele no meu canal para homenagear esse ator que admiro, tão jovem e brilhante, e Duna é simplesmente fantástico, e atuação dele em Me Chame pelo seu nome é perfeita",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Absolutely love this movie ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D

"Just from the theater. This is a masterpiece. WB don't be greedy, Netflix throws 400 mlns on Knives Out sequels. It's not about money, it's about reputation, it brings honor to the company. Let Deni Villeneuve start the production of the sequel! We need the second part!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"I love this second version of DUNE, watching it again for at least the fourth time, so much more profound and well done than the kitschy first time. This one catches much more immediate attention I can't wait until make a second one.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D

"I love the cinematography of this movie, great acting and awesome sound effects",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"If this movie turns out to be 4 hours long, it still might not be enough for me.  It looks absolutely magnificent.  Hoping beyond hope that they've finally done Herbert's story justice.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Love the books, love the movie. Can't wait for the sequel!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Visual & auditory masterpiece. Timothée was born for that character and absolutely killed it! Can’t wait for the second movie in november! ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I just realized Stilgar’s expression when Paul talks about his father. He’s now realizing that Paul’s father wasn’t like the Oppressing Harkonnens. This is the lead up to Stilgar’s and Paul’s relationship later on and the fact that it’s shown through Javier Bardem’s expression makes it perfect.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Just finished watching. Not gonna lie, this movie was a true masterpiece. Finally a sci-fi world that was so easy to get invested in. I knew this was gonna be good from the director all the way to costume designer. A true masterpiece",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D

"Interesting Fact,
Frank Herbert's Dune was so complicated and ahead of its time, some filmmakers in the 70s couldn't catch up to the novel's setting and had to cancel due to high budget.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Very well done film. Beautifully shot and fantastic characters all around with a very good list of actors and actresses to your disposa,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D

Hans Zimmer made Dune what it should actually sound like. Masterpiece,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
I always return to this trailer even after seeing the movie three times already. Part Two the most anticipated movie of 2023! ,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Very well develepoed music. It sets 90% of this mood and it still knock me off my back.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
My absolute favourite movie of all time!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Really refreshing experience after lots of superhero blockbusters lately. I really loved that the movie takes its time and isn't afraid of making its audience really pay attention with it's world building. I was a little surprised by it being a part one since I didn't see any of that during advertisement. Although I don't mind it since this movie clearly needs more time than it's current runtime to cover the whole book. I am just really hoping that Warner doesn't block the second part due to a low turnout. That would be heartbreaking after such a strong start.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"It was a great movie , can't wait for the next plot.    quite excited for the release of part II.",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Excellent breakdown! I had a general idea of how it all worked but this really ties it all together with real world comparisons.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Interesting movie! Hope it doesn't end here! How else can I honestly judge it, without it's real end!!!",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Arrakis = Iraq
Spice harvesting = Oil extraction

Everything about this film so far is so amazing.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
"Unbelievable scenes, the acting was amazing too, loved the trailer",ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
The last fight scene is basically just showing that Paul is a Badass and Genuine Leader when called upon to do so. Cause he uplifts his people to become better and stronger in their faith as they grow.,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
Even though I’ve seen the movie this trailer still gives me chills!,ygUERHVuZQ%3D%3D
